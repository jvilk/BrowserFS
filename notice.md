# DEPRECATION AND FORK NOTICE

Hey there, this is the current maintainer of BrowserFS.

I've been working on BrowserFS for over a year now, and have made some big improvements.

A few months ago, I began seperating some backends from BrowserFS to be placed into different packages. Along with this, I created the browser-fs organization on Github and the browserfs organization on NPM. I made new organizations to keep the repositories and packages organized. Another reason I did so was because John Vilk, the original author of the project, no longer had the time to administer the project. This means at the time of writing this, I still do not have access to the NPM package.

I feel that now, the project has changed so significantly it is no longer the same BrowserFS. Even the name, *Browser*FS, implies it is meant for browsers, which it has outgrown. For that reason, I think that the project should be something new, but still carry the legacy of BrowserFS. I've decided to call it **ZenFS**, since a core goal of mine is ease of use and peace of mind.

In a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, Isaac Newton famously wrote "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants". This is most certainly true in the case of ZenFS. Without the creation of BrowserFS, I would not have found it and been amazed at a complete file system in Typescript/Javascript.

I would like to extend my deepest thanks to Dr. Emery Berger. Shortly after submitting my first pull request to BrowserFS, I reached out about becoming a maintainer of the project. Dr. Berger welcomed my maintainership of the project, and greatly helped in some other matters.

Thank you very much to the community for helping me with this project by submitting issues and pull requests.

The NPM organization `browserfs` has had all of its packages deprecated, with a message pointing to the new package as well as this notice. All of the versions published under `@browserfs` have also been published under `@zenfs`.

I hope that ZenFS can continue the legacy of BrowserFS, and can reach the same popularity and reliability.

Until next time,
